As we make our way through October 2019, is our St. Louis market a buyer’s or seller’s market?

Actually, it’s neither. **It’s a transitioning market.**&nbsp;

The lower price ranges favor sellers because demand is still high and supply is limited. Above the $500,000 price point, however, demand starts to decrease and conditions tilt more in favor of buyers. &nbsp;

What does our housing inventory look like? How does that affect home values?

For homes under the $500,000 mark, there is less than three months of inventory, which, again, is good news for sellers. Above $500,000, there’s almost seven months’ worth of inventory. If you’re a buyer in this price range, the good news is that properties that previously weren’t accepting contingent offers now are.&nbsp;

**Interest rates, meanwhile, are still in the 3.5% range, which is historically low and creates tremendous buying and refinancing opportunities.&nbsp;**

At the moment, the big winners in our market are move-up buyers. If they’re selling below $500,000, they can take advantage of strong demand, and if they’re buying above $500,000, they have a strong chance of getting their contingent offer accepted. Additionally, they’ll be able to find homes for a greater discount than they were able to in previous months.&nbsp;
