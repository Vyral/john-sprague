If you’re in the process of searching for a home to buy, here are a few questions you should be asking about all of the homes you’re considering:

**1\. How is the neighborhood/area?** It’s really important to look in those blue-chip areas where homes will appreciate at a higher clip and result in much higher equity when you eventually sell.

**2\. How are the schools in the area?** We know that here in St. Louis, home prices and values are driven dramatically by the school districts, accreditation, and ratings. One of the best resources you can use is greatschools.org. You should be able to find all the information you might need here.

**3\. What are the average utility bills?** This is important because you want to make sure that the cost of living is well within your means.

**4\. What are the ages of the major mechanical systems?** How old are the home’s furnace, water heater, plumbing, etc.? You want to make sure these are up to par before making an offer.
