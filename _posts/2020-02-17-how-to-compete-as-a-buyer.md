<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing four ways buyers can compete against others in our market.</em></p>

Today I wanted to discuss what buyers should be doing to compete in today’s market:

**1\. Get pre-approved.** Getting pre-approved will help save you many thousands of dollars throughout the life of the loan. Your offer will also stand out to the sellers.&nbsp;

**2\. Have a lifestyle consultation.** We need to get together and have a clear idea of what you’re looking for and prioritize those needs. If you have a spouse, we should make sure you’re both on the same page for the vision of this new home. We have an easy exercise we go through to ensure this.&nbsp;

**3\. Assess the value of the desired areas.** We need to know when walking through a property whether it’s a good deal or not.&nbsp;

**4\. Look at homes.** Check out the flow of the houses and feel of the neighborhoods you’re looking in.&nbsp;

After these happen, we can build a plan to ensure you beat the competition and get to buy the property at a fair price.&nbsp;

If you would like to explore what we can do to lead you down the path to success, give me a call or send me an email. Also, if you have any questions about buying a home or real estate in general, please feel free to contact me. I would love to help you.
