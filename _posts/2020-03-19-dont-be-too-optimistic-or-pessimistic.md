In light of the current health scare, I wanted to provide information on what’s going on right now.&nbsp;

Should we be unnecessarily pessimistic about the coronavirus? Should we be stocking our shelves full of toilet paper and hand sanitizer in preparation for a doomsday event? Or should we be overconfident and think that nothing is happening and that it’ll blow over in a day or two? The third camp is likely the ideal option: **Recognize that there could be an impact on our market and on us personally, professionally, and culturally.&nbsp;**

Here at Onward Property Partners, we’re in the third group. We’re focusing on what we know so we can ensure our family, friends, and clients have the advantage of knowing when opportunities arise. We know that in times of uncertainty, right around the corner comes opportunity. Look for opportunities\!

Currently, buyers are still buying. In the last 24 hours (as of the recording of this video) 8.25% of the homes on the market in St. Louis County went under contract. Inventory continues to decline, so it’s an opportune time for sellers. Also, **if you’re considering moving up, now may be the best time.&nbsp;**

Additional opportunities will present themselves. We’re currently keeping a short list of people who want to be kept informed of what’s going on and want to be the first to know about new opportunities, whether it’s buying, selling, or investing.&nbsp;

If you’d like to be on our list, please call or email us. Also, contact us if you have any questions. We’re here to help.
